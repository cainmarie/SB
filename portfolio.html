            <p>Weatherly is a fictional weather app I created and designed for a UI/UX project. My goal was to create a
                mockup that
                would resemble the app's live navigation from the home screen to its secondary screens and menu. I
                wanted to create a fast-paced navigation with quick transitions and simple layouts. The
                final GIF was output from After Effects and spans about 10 seconds.</p>

            <p>This project called for a 3D animated video that would showcase skills like modeling, rigging, and
                animating. I chose to create an advertisement for the Digital Combat Simulator, a video game with 3D
                graphics. My final product was a 20-second ad displaying a dogfight between 3D model jets on YouTube
                that demonstrated the exciting and visually engaging graphics of DCS.</p>

            <p>Catalyst is a television series covering the research done at Arizona State University, and the program
                needed an animated segue bumper. My goal for this project was to incorporate the series branding while
                adding more creative and playful tones to the animation. The final project was an 8-second bumper
                including Catalyst's logo, icons, and motto animated and published on YouTube.</p>

            <p> For this project, the goal was to create lower thirds for a sports network that would present content in
                visually engaging animations. I chose to create lower thirds for the UFC, and I made quick, angular
                transitions to introduce content like fighter names and event bouts. The final output was a 14-second
                YouTube video demonstrating the transitions of 3 tiers of lower thirds.</p>

                Local Pittsburgh musician AVSTN reached out to me with the idea of a music video for his upcoming song,
                Catch A Break. The project entailed a fully animated 2D video that would tell an entertaining story to
                go along with the song. I created a simple narrative with cartoon designs and silly characters to create
                a fun and engaging animation, and the final product was a 3-minute long animated music video.</p>

            <p>In this project, I was tasked with creating a movie poster that would focus on masking and Photoshop
                skills. I created a fictional movie, photographed images to use in the composition, and designed the
                poster layout. My final outcome was a 27” x 40” design in Photoshop using several masking tools, blend
                modes, and photo editing.</p>
